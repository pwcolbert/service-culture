Doctoral research program investigating service culture in limited-time teams


What role does team culture serve in team performance for limited-time, high performing teams? Limited-time project teams are unique in that members agree to deliver a set of outcomes within the bounds of time. Even when the activities aimed at delivering the required outcomes are well-defined by managers in the organization, the leaders charged with execution must first guide the formation of norms and tempo for rapid, productive assembly. Team membership and temporary organizations are becoming central to working life, and this temporary organizing often occurs outside a single firm’s boundaries.


We pursue this research with a deep interest in understanding servant leadership in a variety of contexts and providing practical advice for leaders toward building high-performance teams. Central to our analysis are the contextual factors that contribute to effectiveness in driving high team performance, including servant leadership, team cohesion, trust in team and trust in leader, team serving culture, the significance of the team’s mission, the amount of time spent onboarding new team members, and team size.


We created and distributed a survey instrument to individuals involved in projects within the Cloud Research platform community. The survey measured perceived levels of team performance as a consequence of team serving culture among the independent contextual factors. 


Our findings indicate that servant leadership behaviors have a direct positive effect on team serving culture in limted-time teams. More importantly, the results reveal how team serving culture mediates the relationship between servant leadership behaviors and performance. We also confirm and explore a direct positive relationship between the significance of the team’s mission and project performance outcomes.


We expect this research contribution to benefit practitioners in organizations and scholars in the organizational behavior field as we: 1) provide additional empirical evidence for the link between servant leadership and team performance, 2) explore servant leadership in the context of limited-time and temporary organizations, and 3) identify contextual variables that act as moderators on team performance in time-bound teams.
